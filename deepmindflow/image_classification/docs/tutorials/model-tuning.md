# Master the Art of Low Code Hyperparameter Tuning

In the pursuit of optimal model performance, hyperparameter tuning plays a pivotal role. Low code hyperparameter tuning is a game-changer, simplifying the process while maximizing efficiency. In this guide, we'll dive into the world of low-code hyperparameter tuning, providing you with the tools to elevate your model's capabilities effortlessly.

## Embrace Low Code Hyperparameter Tuning

### Streamlining Model Optimization 

Picture achieving model optimization seamlessly, akin to orchestrating a symphony. Low code hyperparameter tuning allows you to do just that with your image classification models. To harness its potential, follow these meticulously crafted steps:

### Configure Hyperparameter Search:
* Select a Scheduler: Choose a scheduler that aligns with your computational resources and optimization objectives. Options include `--asha`, `-pbt`, and `--pb2`, each bringing its unique strengths to the table.
* Define the number of samples to search for hyperparameters using `--num_samples`. This determines the breadth of the search space.
* Specify the number of CPUs per trial with `--cpus_per_trial`. Adjust this parameter based on your computational resources.
* Determine the number of GPUs per trial using `--gpus_per_trial`. Set this according to your GPU availability.
* Choose the hyperparameter search algorithm with `--search_algo`. Options include "bohb," but you can explore others based on your preferences.

```bash
python tune.py --num_samples 16 --cpus_per_trial 2 --gpus_per_trial 0 --search_algo bohb
```

### Define Hyperparameters for Tuning:
* Tune the batch size with `--tune_batch_size`.
* Optimize the learning rate and weight decay of an optimizer using `--tune_opt`.
* Adjust the label smoothing factor with `--tune_smoothing`.
* Fine-tune warmup epochs, warmup decay, and learning rate scheduler hyperparameters with `--tune_sched`.
* Optimize the dropout rate with `--tune_dropout`.
* Select the best data augmentation technique from options like augmix, rand, and trivial using `--tune_aug_type`.
* Choose the best data interpolation method from nearest, bilinear, and bicubic with `--tune_interpolation`.
* Tune the mixup alpha with `--tune_mixup`.
* Tune the cutmix alpha with `--tune_cutmix`.
* Adjust the FGSM epsilon value with `--tune_fgsm`.
* Fine-tune the model pruning rate with `--tune_prune`.

Example usage:
```bash
python tune.py \
    --dataset /weather_data/ \
    --experiment_name mixup \
    --output_dir more \
    --model_name efficientvit_b1 \
    --num_samples 33 \
    --gpus_per_trial 1 \
    --tune_batch_size \
    --tune_opt \
    --tune_sched 
```
