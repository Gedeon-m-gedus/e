# Master the Art of Model Selection

Are you ready to embark on a journey where the right choice can transform your project into a masterpiece? Welcome to the world of model selection, where we'll explore three efficient ways to select models for training. Get ready to supercharge your projects with the perfect model choice!

## Method 1: Precision with Specifics

### Handpick Your Champion

When you know exactly which model you need, don't waste a moment. Use the `--model_name` argument to choose it, like a true connoisseur. For example, let's choose the `dm_nfnet_f4.dm_in1k` model:

```bash
python train.py --model_name dm_nfnet_f4.dm_in1k
```

Or, why settle for one when you can have many? Select multiple models in one go:

```bash
python train.py --model_name dm_nfnet_f4.dm_in1k dm_nfnet_f2.dm_in1k
```

## Method 2: Size Does Matter

### Embrace the Power of Scale

Sometimes, it's all about the size. Tailor your project with models of different scales by choosing from `["nano", "tiny", "small", "base", "large", "giant"]` and setting the `--model_size` argument.

 For instance, to train with small models:

```bash
python train.py --model_size small
```

## Method 3: Submodules Unleashed

### The Magic Within

Explore the magic of submodules and watch your project come to life. Select from:

`["beit", "convnext", "deit", "resnet", "vision_transformer", "efficientnet", "xcit", "regnet", "nfnet", "metaformer", "fastvit", "efficientvit_msra"]` or more using the `--module` argument.

For instance, to harness the power of ResNet:

```bash
python train.py --module resnet
```

### One Rule to Rule Them All

Remember: You can only choose one method at a time. The right choice is your ticket to success.

## Conclusion

Selecting the right model is the first step toward achieving greatness in your image classification projects. Whether you have a specific model in mind, prefer models of a certain size, or want to explore submodules, you now have the knowledge to make informed choices. Happy model selection! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
