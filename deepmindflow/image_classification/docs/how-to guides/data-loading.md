# Elevate Your Image Classification Journey with Dataset Loading Mastery

Are you ready to unlock the true potential of your deep learning projects? Welcome to the world of dataset loading, where the right choices lead to boundless opportunities. In this guide, we'll unveil two dazzling methods to load datasets, whether they're stored locally or hosted on the magnificent Hugging Face platform. Let's embark on this thrilling journey!

## Method 1: Unleash the Power of Local Datasets

### Your Local Kingdom of Data

Imagine having your dataset at your fingertips. You're the master of your domain! To load a local dataset, simply provide the directory path to your image dataset using the `--dataset` argument. Make sure your dataset is neatly organized into training, validation, and test sets, each with its unique classes. Here's how to do it:

```bash
python train.py --dataset ../datasets/weather_data
```

Do you need to split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets effortlessly? We've got your back! Our `utils` module offers nifty helper functions like `CreateImgSubclasses` and `create_train_val_test_splits` to make it a breeze.

## Method 2: The Hugging Face Enchantment

### Unearth the Treasures of Hugging Face

Hugging Face is a magical realm of datasets, and you can access its wonders effortlessly. Just utter the name of the image classification dataset you desire using the `--dataset` argument. It's like summoning a genie! For example:

```bash
python train.py --dataset beans
```

But wait, there's more! You can wield even greater control by passing additional arguments. Customize your dataset loading with finesse by passing a configuration file to `--dataset_kwargs` like beans_kwargs.json when loading the beans dataset:

```bash
python train.py --dataset beans --dataset_kwargs beans_kwargs.json
```

## Notes for Triumph

Note: Ensure that your local dataset is like a well-arranged library, with separate sections for each dataset split (train, validation, and test). For more intricate dataset setups, our utils library is your trusty sidekick, ready to assist you.

## Conclusion: Blaze Your Trail

Whether you're diving into the depths of your local dataset kingdom or tapping into the boundless riches of Hugging Face, you now possess the art of dataset loading. Your journey into the realm of image classification mastery begins here!

## Bonus Tip: Keep Exploring

As you continue your adventure in the world of image classification, consider venturing further into custom datasets and the enchanting realm of data augmentation. Your projects will shine even brighter!
