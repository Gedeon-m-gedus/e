# Unlock the Power of ONNX: Convert Models with Ease

The ONNX format is your gateway to model interoperability and deployment across different deep learning frameworks. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to seamlessly convert your trained models to ONNX format. Whether you have a single model or an entire ensemble, we've got you covered.

## Step 1: Understanding the Conversion Workflow

### A Seamless Transition

Before diving into the conversion process, it's essential to grasp the workflow. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

- During the training process, the best-performing model is automatically converted to ONNX format. This ensures that you have the top-performing model ready for deployment.

- However, there are scenarios where you might want to convert all your trained models to ONNX format. To trigger this, simply include `--to_onnx` as a CLI argument when launching your conversion script.

## Step 2: Bulk Conversion with `--to_onnx`

### The Power of Choice

The `--to_onnx` CLI argument is your key to bulk model conversion. By including this argument in your script, you're instructing the conversion tool to transform all your trained models into ONNX format.

Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
python train.py --to_onnx
```

## Conclusion: Embrace Model Portability

The ability to convert models to ONNX format grants you the freedom to deploy your models across a wide range of deep learning frameworks seamlessly. It's a step towards model portability and interoperability, making your models accessible and versatile.
